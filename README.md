# Dotfiles

This repository contains configuration files for my linux mint 18.3. I made this repository to make me easier if I reinstall my linux mint.

## Use it

(TODO) Basicaly:

- Clone this repo
- Make script to backup existing configuration (if any)
- make symlink to each file and folder on home directory
